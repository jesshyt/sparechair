      <div class="row">
        <div class='col-sm-12'>
          <p>There are nine million lonely people in the UK. We see reducing this number as our responsibiity </p>
          <p>Feeling lonely can have a negative impact on your mental health and wellbeing.</p>
          <p>Spare Chair is a non-profit organisation which connects people over meals to reduce loneliness. We believe in the power of connection, compassion and shared experiences.</p>
          <p>Spair Chair was founded in 2018 by CodeFirst participants Jess Hytten, Georgia Knightingale and Grace Youell who shared the same vision for a more connected world. Their mission statement is simple. To combat loneliness through meaningful connection around the dinner table.</p>

          <p>Since October 2018, Spare Chair has connected over 200 people around the dinner table.</p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"When my husband of 52 years passed away last year, mealtimes became one of the loneliest parts of the day as I was so aware of the empty places at the table. A friend of mine mentioned Spare Chair to me one weekend and I got in touch later that day. I think it was only a week before I was being invited round for dinner with families in the local area. I enjoyed the experience so much that I’ve even started hosting a few of my own and offering out the spare chairs at my table! Quite frankly, I owe my sanity to Spare Chair."</font></p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"Our children have grown up and recently moved out and so we thought one day, ‘why not make use of the extra chairs we have?!’ After a quick search online, we came across Spare chair and immediately knew it was perfect for us. Through the campaign, we invite people over almost weekly now - we love it that much! As well as filling our dinner table, we’ve made lots of new friends in our town, so thank you Spare Chair!"</font></p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"I moved to the area recently after getting a job here. I didn’t know anyone that lived close by and in the beginning I was struggling to find my feet. I saw an advert for Spare Chair in the local paper and thought ‘what have I got to lose!’ At first, it was a little daunting reaching out for help, but I’m so glad I did. Spare Chair has really helped me integrate into the local community and settle in. I’d definitely encourage anyone in a similar position to me to get in touch with Spare Chair!"</font></p>

        <h3>Chair to Share?</h3>
        <p>“The best way to find yourself is lose yourself in the service of others.” Mahatma Gandhi</p>
        <p>People who live a life of service live a life of greatness.</p>
        <p> Offering a space at your dinner table is an example of an act of kindness which will boost your energy levels for the rest of the week. One conversation with someone new could transform your life. We are just asking you to give someone a chance for one dinner! </p>
        <p>Sign up to meet new people, and possibly new friends, for dinner!</p>

        <h3>Do You Want a Chair?</h3>
        <p> Individuals who describe themselves as lonely usually do so for two reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>They do not see or talk to anyone very often</li>
          <li>They are surrounded by people but do not feel understood or cared for</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Just as hunger is an indication that your body needs food, loneliness is an indication that you need more meaningful social interaction.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to cure feelings of loneliness is to meet more, or different, people.</p>
        <p>Sign up to meet new people, and possibly new friends, for dinner!</p>
