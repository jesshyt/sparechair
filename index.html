        <div class='col-sm-12'>
          <p>There are nine million lonely people in the UK.</p>
          <p>Being alone is different to being lonely. Feeling lonely can have a negative impact on your mental health. Reducing this number is our responsibility.</p>
          <p>Spare Chair is a non-profit organisation which believes that for every person who feels lonely there is a person who would welcome them at their dinner table. We believe in the power of connection and compassion.</p>
          <p>Spair Chair was founded in 2018 by three young professionals, Jess, Georgia and Grace, who shared the same vision for a more connected world. Their mission statement is simple. To combat loneliness through meaningful connection around the dinner table.</p>

          <p>Since it began in October 2018, Spare Chair has brought together over 200 people around the dinner table; those both in need of a chair and those with a chair to spare.</p>
          <p>Here’s what some of them had to say about their experiences:</p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"When my husband of 52 years passed away last year, mealtimes became one of the loneliest parts of the day as I was so aware of the empty places at the table. A friend of mine mentioned Spare Chair to me one weekend and I got in touch later that day. I think it was only a week before I was being invited round for dinner with families in the local area. I enjoyed the experience so much that I’ve even started hosting a few of my own and offering out the spare chairs at my table! Quite frankly, I owe my sanity to Spare Chair."</font></p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"Our children have grown up and recently moved out and so we thought one day, ‘why not make use of the extra chairs we have?!’ After a quick search online, we came across Spare chair and immediately knew it was perfect for us. Through the campaign, we invite people over almost weekly now - we love it that much! As well as filling our dinner table, we’ve made lots of new friends in our town, so thank you Spare Chair!"</font></p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"I moved to the area recently after getting a job here. I didn’t know anyone that lived close by and in the beginning I was struggling to find my feet. I saw an advert for Spare Chair in the local paper and thought ‘what have I got to lose!’ At first, it was a little daunting reaching out for help, but I’m so glad I did. Spare Chair has really helped me integrate into the local community and settle in. I’d definitely encourage anyone in a similar position to me to get in touch with Spare Chair"</font></p>
