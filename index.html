          <p>Since it began in October 2018, Spare Chair has brought together over 200 people around the dinner table; those both in need of a chair and those with a chair to spare.</p>
          <p>Here’s what some of them had to say about their experiences:</p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"When my husband of 52 years passed away last year, mealtimes became one of the loneliest parts of the day as I was so aware of the empty places at the table. A friend of mine mentioned Spare Chair to me one weekend and I got in touch later that day. I think it was only a week before I was being invited round for dinner with families in the local area. I enjoyed the experience so much that I’ve even started hosting a few of my own and offering out the spare chairs at my table! Quite frankly, I owe my sanity to Spare Chair."</font></p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"Our children have grown up and recently moved out and so we thought one day, ‘why not make use of the extra chairs we have?!’ After a quick search online, we came across Spare chair and immediately knew it was perfect for us. Through the campaign, we invite people over almost weekly now - we love it that much! As well as filling our dinner table, we’ve made lots of new friends in our town, so thank you Spare Chair!"</font></p>

            <p class="lead"> <font size="-0.5">"I moved to the area recently after getting a job here. I didn’t know anyone that lived close by and in the beginning I was struggling to find my feet. I saw an advert for Spare Chair in the local paper and thought ‘what have I got to lose!’ At first, it was a little daunting reaching out for help, but I’m so glad I did. Spare Chair has really helped me integrate into the local community and settle in. I’d definitely encourage anyone in a similar position to me to get in touch with Spare Chair"</font></p>
